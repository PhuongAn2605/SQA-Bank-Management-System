  # Before running the application, there are few things that you need to do: 

  - Install MongoDB tools for restoring data: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/database-tools

  - Install node modules and all dependencies 

  - I will make a video to show you how to restore data. The vid should be available in the package i send.
